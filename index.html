            This project was completed as the term project for a computer
            animation class. As part of the course requirements, I also prepared
            a
            <a target="_blank" href="media/Fire_Sim_Paper.pdf"
              >conference-style paper (opens in a new tab)</a
            >
            describing my research and implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the video demo, the first thing you might notice is the big
            chunky particles. As the focus of this project is on the simulation
            over high-fidelity graphics, I haven't implemented any sophisticated
            rendering technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simulation model I chose (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) is
            flexible and performant enough to simulate water, fire, or even the
            formation of stars! The simulation is done using an HLSL compute
            shader and therefore it runs on the GPU. This drastically increases
            the number of particles that can be simulated in real-time in order
            to achieve a visually appealing result.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was made with the game engine Unity to bootstrap
            development. Here, Unity is simply used for scene management and
            basic particle rendering. I chose Unity because of my familiarity
            with the engine.

            This is a simplified NES emulator. It includes a complete emulator
            for the 6502 CPU (all opcodes, timing, etc) and a partial
            implementation of the PPU (no sprite rendering). I created it
            alongside 3 classmates to fulfill the requirements for a term
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make it possible to complete this project as a class project, we
            simplified the requirements to only target successfully running a
            specific test ROM. This ROM simply allows the user to change the
            screen color by pressing various buttons on the controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this isn't very visually impressive, it demonstrates the
            complete CPU emulator, controller input, a simplified PPU (Picture
            Processing Unit), and cartridge loading.

        <!-- my language, running, birding?, learning -->
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.

      <h2 class="text-lg">About this site</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a single page of HTML with Tailwind for styling. It
        doesn't use Webpack or any other build tools. It was made with minor
        help from GitHub Copilot, though it wasn't very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose vanilla HTML over demonstrating my knowledge of React because it
        made more sense for the goals of the site: I wanted it to be simple,
        accessible, and performant.
