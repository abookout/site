    <h2 class="text-lg">About this site</h2>
    <p>
      This website is a single page of HTML with Tailwind for styling. It was
      made with minor help from GitHub Copilot, though it wasn't very useful.
      <!-- CD is done using Cloudflare Pages, which is where this site is hosted. My usual CI/CD
        pipeline uses GitHub Actions, but Cloudflare had the functionality, so I
        went with that instead. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose a vanilla HTML implementation over demonstrating my knowledge of
      React because it made more sense for the goals of the site: I wanted it
      to be simple, accessible, and performant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/abookout/site">source code</a> is
      available on my GitHub if you'd like to see how I made it.
