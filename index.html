        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.

      <h2 class="text-lg">About this site</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a single page of HTML with Tailwind for styling. It
        doesn't use Webpack or any other build tools. It was made with minor
        help from GitHub Copilot, though it wasn't very useful.
        <!-- CD is done using Cloudflare Pages, which is where this site is hosted. My usual CI/CD
        pipeline uses GitHub Actions, but Cloudflare had the functionality, so I
        went with that instead. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose a vanilla HTML implementation over demonstrating my knowledge of
        React because it made more sense for the goals of the site: I wanted it
        to be simple, accessible, and performant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source is available
        <a href="https://github.com/abookout/site">on my GitHub</a>
        if you'd like to see how I made it.
